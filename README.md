# **SimpleGUI**
Simple Graphical User Interface for Slick2D
as its name implies, is a graphical user interface library
made specifically for [Slick2D](http://slick.ninjacave.com/) which is a library for creating games for the Java language.
It is simple, but has fundamental widgets such as containers, buttons, labels, text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, and recently popups.
Some of them support images (although it needs some adjustments).

## Download
To download, go to releases.  
The documentation is in <https://lucasdecarvalhobarbosa.github.io/SimpleGUI/>  

## Why was it made for Slick only?
Because it was built on top of Slick primitives, like the Rectangle class.
But its coupling with Slick is not that big, I think porting it to other platforms is not too complicated as long as it has support for basic two-dimensional primitives and text.

## Why did you create a new GUI?
I created a GUI because the interaction of other GUI libraries was not satisfactory to my propose or was too complicated.
In fact, it was created for my final course [project](https://github.com/LucasDeCarvalhoBarbosa/MazeExplorers).
